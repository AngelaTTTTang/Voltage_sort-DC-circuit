# Voltage_sort-DC-circuit
This lab explains the basic concepts of DC circuits. And we explore the internal resistance for the battery in the circuit, learn how to measure the EMF of a lemon, and derive the equation of Wheatstone bridge balance. 

In the first part of the experiment, we assemble the circuits and find the inner resistance of the battery using the fit curve of data, which is (0.460.003)ohm. In the second part of the experiment, we measure the voltage of a lemon which is  and find that its inner resistance is very large. In the last part of the experiment, we use virtual circuits to find out the principle of Wheatstone bridge is : , and we later derive this formula using basic understanding of voltage and current in the lab report.
